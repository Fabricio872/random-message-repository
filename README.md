# Welcome to Random Message Repository

This repo is for messages, jokes, quotes, or anything you want to sometimes see on the loading screen so waiting is not as boring. 

## Contributing

If you want to contribute I will gladly accept anything appropriate in the correct JSON format. 

The best way to ensure your format is correct is to use this [Symfony Bundle](https://github.com/Fabricio872/random-message-bundle) which have built in all necessary tools or use this template and file name is snake_cased version of category name:
```json
{
    "category": "Title",
    "messages": [
        "Joke 1",
        "Joke 2",
        "Joke 3"
    ],
    "language": "en",
    "version": "0.1.0.0"
}
```

## Thank you for any suggestions and contributions
